# REAL-TIME-COLLABORATIVE-DOCUMENT-EDITOR

*COMPANY:- CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME:- MONALISHA SWAIN

*INTERN ID:- CT04DF1291

*DOMAIN:- FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT

*DURATION:- 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR:- NEELA SANTOSH

**  What We Did:
Created a React-based rich-text editor where multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously. All changes are synchronized in real-time using Socket.IO. The editor autosaves content to MongoDB via a Node.js and Express backend.

 Tools Used:
Frontend: React.js (with Vite setup)

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Real-Time Sync: Socket.IO

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)

 Why This is Applicable:
This is one of the most advanced tasks — mimicking features of Google Docs and Notion. It merges full-stack concepts like frontend frameworks, server-side communication, and persistent document storage. It showcases teamwork in web apps, multi-user collaboration, and real-time data management — skills crucial in SaaS startups and remote-first tools. **
